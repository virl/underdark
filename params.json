Allows apps on mobile devices to auto-discover and connect to each other via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth without any intervention from the user and without using any Internet connection. Works both in foreground and background app modes.\r\n2. Allows asynchronous transfer of messages, photos and sounds — all without freezing the UI of the app;\r\n3. Routes messages from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth-connected devices and vice versa — so devices with turned off Wi-Fi will receive all the same data via Bluetooth.\r\n4. Work between Android<-->Android or between iOS<-->iOS via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\r\n5. Works between iOS<-->Android via infrastructure Wi-Fi only.\r\n\r\n# License\r\nThis library may be used for non-commercial and educational purposes only.\r\nIf you want to use it in your products, please contact the author.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
